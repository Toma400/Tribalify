# Tribalify
**Tribalify** is syntax sugar library aimed on creating Nim interface for 
indev programming language called Tribal.  
Tribalify offers Tribal features by adding them onto Nim experience by use of macros,
templates and other procedures. They are all available under `tribalify` file.

Take in mind that Tribalify's syntax may differ from pure Tribal. This is because
the library tries to incorporate itself into current Nim language.

### Why Tribalify?
Just because I love Nim, but there are some things from Tribal language ideas that
I wanted to see there as well. Tribalify is actually heavily inspired by other few
libraries that bring my beloved languages into Nim:
  - classes      - introducing Python-like OOP with class type
  - questionable - introducing Kotlin-like syntax sugar for Option
  - results      - introducing Rust-like Result type
  - with         - introducing JS-like deprecated 'with' feature

So, with such legacy, Tribalify was made as final step. It will try to be as small
as possible, yet trying to add as many Tribal-like features as it can.

### Installation & usage
Write following command in your terminal to install Tribalify using Nimble:
```commandline
nimble install https://github.com/Toma400/Tribalify
```
Once it is done, you can use Tribalify features simply after importing:
```nim
import tribalify

var i = newPair("Tom", "Parker")
whisper("Name of your son is: " & i.first)
```

### New types
- `pair(F, S)` - convenience type for double values:
  - initialise with `newPair()` proc
  - can be stringified (`$`) to get string repr
  - use `.first` and `.second` to get specific field
- `triad(F, S, T)` - convenience type for triple values:
  - initialise with `newTriad()` proc
  - can be stringified (`$`) to get string repr
  - use `.first`, `.second` and `.third` to get specific field

### Aliases
- Types:
  - `str` - alias for `string` type
- Operators:
  - `&&` - alias for `and`
  - `||` - alias for `or`
  - `<>` - alias for `xor` (exclusive OR)
- Procs:
  - `whisper(str)` - proc imitating `echo`. Also aliased as `puts(str)`
  - `scribe(str)` - proc imitating `readLine(stdin)` but with additional string evoking
  echo. Also aliased as `gets(str)`

### Functionalities
- `tab` - key used to separate sections of code aesthetically. Similar to Nim's `block`,
but does not create new scope. Example code:
```nim
block:
  var i = 5
echo i # will result in error, 'i' declared in different scope

tab:
  var y = 5
echo y # will work nicely, 'y' is in the same scope
```

### Syntax sugar
- `<!` and `!>` append elements to mutable collection-like types (equivalent of `.add`)
